## Features

- **Document Upload & Analysis**  
  Upload PDF, image, or text files. The AI analyzes the document and extracts key clauses, risks, and obligations using advanced LLMs.

- **Risk Detection with Severity**  
  The system highlights and categorizes risk clauses as High Risk, Moderate Risk, or Informational, making it easy to spot critical issues.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Review**  
  Users can review the extracted risks, accept the AIâ€™s analysis, or regenerate a new analysis for more confidence.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Accessibility**  
  The AI can read the summary and risks out loud, using different voices for each severity level. Supports multiple languages for accessibility.

- **Translation**  
  Instantly translate the summary and risk factors into several languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Tamil, and Chinese (Simplified).

- **Interactive Q&A Chatbot**  
  Ask questions about any clause or the full document context. The AI provides clear, context-aware answers.
